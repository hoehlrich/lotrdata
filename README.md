# lotrdata
analyzing data from Tolkien's Middle Earth

## Why did you decide to examine this data?
I chose to examine this data because of my interest in Tolkiens works (specifically his Middle Earth Legendarium)

## Where did you get this data?
Kaggle.com

## Context of the data?
The data contains various information about many characters of Middle Earth. Most notably, the character's race, birth year, and death year

## Scatter Plot

This scatter plot shows the average lifespan of different races over time.

### Men
In the First Age of Men, 0-4902 YotS, the life expectancy of Men was the lowest.
In the Second Age, 4902-8343 YotS, the life expectancy of Men was the highest. At the beginning of the SA, Men moved to Numenor, a city closer to Valinor, therefore they ended up living longer.
Starting at around 7,000 YotS, the life expectancy of Men drops drastically. This is called the "Decline of Man". It happened when Numenor fell and Men were forced to move elsewhere.

### Hobbits
There is very little data on Hobbits, but, from the little we know, Hobbits often had a lifespan of slightly under 100 years.

### Dwarves
Dwarvish records only go back as far as the beginning of the Third Age.
The average lifespan of a dwarf is around 250 years.

### Other Mortal Races
Very little data was reported on other mortal races.

### Elves
Elves are immortal so their "life expectancy" is relatively infinite.
